// You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.
// Note :
// Input arrays/lists can contain duplicate elements.

// The intersection elements printed would be in ascending order.

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {

    public static void intersection(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        // Your code goes here
        Arrays.sort(arr1);
        Arrays.sort(arr2);
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
            if (arr1[i] == arr2[j]) {
                System.out.print(arr1[i] + " ");
                i++;
                j++;
            } else if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return;
